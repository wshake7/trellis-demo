# Query and file — Trellis Demo Codebase

When a user asks a question that the wiki should answer:

1. Search the wiki via `wiki-query` (FTS5).
2. If a page already covers the answer, cite it directly. Do not duplicate.
3. If coverage is partial, draft an addendum to the existing page.
4. If no coverage, create the appropriate page type (concept/paper/question/...).
5. If still uncertain, file a `question/<slug>.md` and append it as a seed for the research loop (Phase 3.3.1+).

Always echo the answer with citations. Never fabricate citations.
